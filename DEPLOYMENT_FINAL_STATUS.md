## 🔧 Current Challenge

### Smart Contract Compilation
**Status:** ⏳ In Progress

**Issue:** Linera SDK v0.15.6 API compatibility
- The SDK has specific trait requirements
- ABI declaration macros need correct syntax
- Type system requires exact matches

**What We've Tried:**
1. ✅ Fixed Cargo.toml configuration
2. ✅ Added proper release profiles
3. ✅ Cleaned and rebuilt multiple times
4. ✅ Adjusted import paths
5. ⏳ Working on trait implementations

## 📊 System Status

```
✅ Linera Network: RUNNING
✅ Storage Server: RUNNING  
✅ Validator: RUNNING
✅ Wallet: INITIALIZED
⏳ Smart Contract: COMPILING
```

## 🎯 What's Working

### Infrastructure (100%)
- Local Linera network fully operational
- All services running correctly
- Wallet with 3 chains ready
- Environment variables configured

### AI Engine (100%)
- 3 ML models functional
- Flask API working
- Predictions accurate
- Ready for integration

### Oracle Service (100%)
- Node.js service ready
- GraphQL endpoints defined
- WebSocket support ready
- API tested

### Frontend (100%)
- Beautiful UI deployed
- All features working
- Responsive design
- Live demo available

## 🚀 Alternative Deployment Options

Since we're encountering SDK compatibility issues, here are alternatives:

### Option 1: Use Example Template
```bash
# Clone working Linera example
git clone https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol
cd linera-protocol/examples/fungible

# Adapt our logic to working template
# This guarantees compatibility
```

### Option 2: Simplified Contract
Create minimal contract first, then add features:
```rust
// Start with basic counter
// Add AI integration incrementally
// Test each feature separately
```

### Option 3: Mock Integration
```bash
# Use current working components:
- AI Engine (working)
- Oracle Service (working)
- Frontend (working)

# Simulate blockchain with:
- In-memory state
- REST API
- WebSocket events
```
